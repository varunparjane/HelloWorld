Write a program to find a matching groom for a given bride.You have
been given an array of grooms by personality-type-number (integer array
A), personality-type-number of a bride (integer B), 1 round shortlist
count (integer X), 2 round shortlist count (integer Y). Write a
program to find the matched groom's personality-type-number.

Input
10
5 10 20 2 4 5 1 9 50 8
6
5
3

where
First line contains number of grooms (integer N)
Second line contains list of grooms denoted by personality-typenumber
(integer array A)
Third line contains a bride's personality-type-number (integer B)
Fourth line contains 1 round shortlist count (integer X)
Fifth line contains 2 round shortlist count (integer Y)

Output
9

Selection process
Selection of groom by personality-type-number is a 3-round elimination
process.

Round 1: Find X grooms by personality-type-number out of array A closest
matching to B.
e.g.
Bride’s personality-type-number B = 6
Array of grooms of personality-type-number A = [5, 10, 20, 2, 4, 5,
1, 9, 50, 8]
1st round shortlist count X = 5
Here 5 grooms closest to bride are 0 (5), 4 (4), 5 (5), 7 (9) and
9 (8). These grooms are shortlisted for 2 round.
Note: If matched number of candidates is more than shortlist value X,
return -1.

Round 2: Find Y grooms out of shortlisted candidates ranked by quantity
of 1 in their binary representation of personality-type-number.
e.g.
Array after round 1 = [5, 4, 5, 9, 8]
2 level shortlist count Y = 3
Binary codes of the array is:
[0101, 0100, 0101, 1001, 1000]
The 3 shortlisted grooms are 0 (5), 2 (5) and 3 (9). These grooms
denoted by their personality-type-number are shortlisted for 3 round.
Note: If matched number of candidates exceeds shortlist value Y, return
-2.

Round 3: Find the groom who has highest GCF(Greatest Common Factor)
value in common with the bride’s personality-type-number.
e.g.
Array after round 2 = [5, 5, 9]
Bride’s personality-type number B = 6
GCF of groom with personality-type number (9) and the bride’s
personality-type number (6) is greater than of grooms with personalitytype
number (5) and the bride’s personality-type number (6)
= GCF of (9, 6) > GCF of (5, 6)
= 3 > 1
If only 1 groom is remaining, the function should return selected
groom's personality-type value 9.
Note: If matched number of candidates is more than 1, return -3.

Assumptions:
Personality-type-number values is in the range [1 to 100000].
Number of grooms who can participate is in the range 1 to 1000.
